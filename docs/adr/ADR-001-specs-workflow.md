# ADR-001: Adopt Specs-Driven Workflow

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We want a consistent, repeatable learning and delivery loop for MCP server/client work.

## Decision
Adopt a specs-driven workflow with:
- `specs/plan.md` as the checklist of specs
- `specs/Sxxx.md` per spec
- `docs/workflow.md` documenting the loop

## Consequences
- Clear visibility into progress and completion criteria.
- Slight overhead to keep specs and plan updated.
