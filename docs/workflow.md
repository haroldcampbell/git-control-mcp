# Workflow

This project uses a specs-driven loop for learning and implementation.

## Steps
1. Choose a spec to work on.
2. Ensure you are on a clean branch.
3. Make a plan to implement the spec.
4. Validate the plan with the user.
5. Do the work iteratively and ensure tests pass.
6. Commit the work if everything passes.
7. Move to the next spec and repeat the loop.
