# S016: Dedicated worktree tool with absolute paths

## Title
Dedicated worktree tool with absolute paths

## Spec Summary
Add a first-class `worktree` MCP tool that supports all git worktree subcommands and enforces absolute paths for any worktree path arguments.

## Spec Goal
Provide a safe, explicit worktree interface that validates required arguments and rejects relative paths.

## DoD checklist
- [x] Implement `worktree` tool in `src/git_control/tools.py` with absolute-path enforcement
- [x] Wire the tool in `src/git_control/server.py`
- [x] Add a root script and document it in `scripts/README.md`
- [x] Update `docs/git-control.md` and `docs/git-control-test.md`
- [x] Add tests and a milestone test spec
- [x] Update `specs/plan.md`
