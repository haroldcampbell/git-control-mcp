# S014: Git control regression test suite

## Title
Git control regression test suite

## Spec Summary
Add a comprehensive pytest suite for git-control tools, plus a milestone folder that tracks each test case as an individual spec.

## Spec Goal
Prevent regression and code loss by validating git-control tool behavior with real git repositories and explicit edge-case coverage.

## DoD checklist
- [x] Create `specs/milestones/git-control-tests/` with one spec per test case
- [x] Add pytest-based tests for git-control tools (stage, delete, commit, fetch, checkout, push, run_git, PR creation)
- [x] Provide a documented testing strategy and PR plan
- [x] Update `specs/plan.md` to include S014
