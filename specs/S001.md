# S001: Restructure into server-client architecture

## Title
Restructure into server-client architecture

## Spec Summary
Split the current MCP server into clear modules (API, tools, server entry) and add a simple client to exercise the tools over stdio.

## Spec Goal
Improve clarity and learning by separating concerns and providing a reusable client for local testing.

## DoD checklist
- [ ] Server logic separated into API helpers and MCP tools
- [ ] Server entry point runs via stdio transport
- [ ] New client module can call `get_alerts` and `get_forecast`
- [ ] README or docs updated to reflect new structure
