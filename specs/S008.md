# S008: Branch checkout and push tools

## Title
Branch checkout and push tools

## Spec Summary
Add git-control MCP tools and helper scripts for creating a new branch and pushing it to origin, plus documentation updates.

## Spec Goal
Enable branch creation and upstream push operations via MCP so PR creation can be fully automated without direct git commands.

## DoD checklist
- [x] Add `checkout_branch` and `push_branch` tools wired through the MCP server
- [x] Provide helper scripts for the new tools
- [x] Update the git-control test plan with branch and push steps
- [x] Ensure git-control logging captures calls for branch checkout, push, and deletion staging
